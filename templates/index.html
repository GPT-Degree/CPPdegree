    <p><small><strong>Please Note: The estimates above apply to full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students only. Please Note: The estimates above apply to full-time, 
      first time degree seeking undergraduate students only. Tuition and fee estimates are based on 15 or more units per semester.
      These estimates do not represent a final determination, or actual award, of financial assistance or a final net price; 
      they are only estimates based on cost of attendance and financial aid provided to students in 2019-20. Cost of attendance and financial aid availability change year to year. 
      These estimates shall not be binding on the Secretary of Education, the institution of higher education, or the State.
      Not all students receive financial aid. In 2019-20,70% of our full-time students enrolling for college for the first time received grant/scholarship aid. 
      Students may also be eligible for student loans and work-study. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to determine their eligibility for Federal 
      financial aid that includes Federal grant, loan, or work-study assistance. For more information on applying for Federal student aid, go to http://www.fafsa.ed.gov. 
      The Cal Poly Pomona Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships website has information and videos on current cost estimates, aid programs, and available resources.

      This estimate does not include California Dream Act grants, any tuition waivers, or any privately funded grants, scholarships, or loans. 
      Students may be eligible for additional aid based on their individual circumstances. For more information, contact the Cal Poly Pomona Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships.
